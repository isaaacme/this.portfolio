          Iâ€™ve always been creating. from drawing and music to coding websites
          and creating concepts for all types of projects. my career as a
          designer begun as an autodidact, designing party brochures and
          t-shirts for friends, until finally deciding to study formally,
          graduating in 2011 as a print designer.

          It took a couple of years but when I discovered the digital world and
          HTML & CSS, I was amazed at the limitless opportunities that space
          allowed, and so I worked constantly to sharp my coding skills and the
          learning all I could regarding what are digital products and how I
          could incorporate my previous experience to push me forward in this
          space.
          Now Iâ€™m in a place where I believe I can bring maximum value to
          my clients by going through the entire product cycle: from ideation,
          move into production, and then finally launch followed by continuous
          optimization.
