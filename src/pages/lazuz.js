          <h3>The Challenge</h3>
          <p>
            People do not persevere on their fitness goals, because there’s no
            immediate tangible value in the process
          </p>
          <h3>The Solution</h3>
          <p>
            providing a platform for receiving and giving support and feedback
            which keep users focused on their goals and encourages moving
            forward

          <h3>SCARCITY AS A SERVICE</h3>
          <p>
            On averge, a Gym can hold about 30% of their actual paying memebers.
            this is actually the financial model for gyms overall. Diving into
            further research shows the reason people don’t persist is actually
            rooted in the lack of short term feedback and support from the
            environment, resulting in frustration and eventually quitting
            altogether.
          </p>
          <h3>REASEARCH CONCLUSION</h3>
          <p>
            A circle of short and constant feedback loops is essential for
            people in order for them to advance and achieve their fitness goals.

          <h3>ONLINE SURVEY</h3>
          <p>
            In addition to personal interviews with potential users, I ran an
            online questionnaire which showed people were aware of outdoor gyms
            but not considered them a viable alternative to the commercial Gym
            they were members of.

            The onboarding experience is a crucial element for the app,
            providing as much value and engagement on the front to the user,
            making sure he is involved and ready to move forward with the
            process.
